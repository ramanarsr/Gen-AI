The deep neural network model achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 92%, precision of 91%, recall of 90%, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95. The model's reliance on widely available and non-invasive features, such as blood tests and demographic data, makes it especially valuable in low-resource environments. The study's findings demonstrate the potential of machine learning to augment or even replace conventional screening methods, and the use of SHAP for interpretability helps address concerns about the \"black box\" nature of machine learning models. The research has promising implications for earlier treatment and better prognosis, and future work should investigate how these models perform across different population subgroups to avoid reinforcing health disparities.\n",
